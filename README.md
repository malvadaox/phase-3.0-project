# SYRIATEL CUSTOMER CHURN PROJECT
______________________________________________________________________

## Overview
------------------------------------------------
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to discontinue their relationship with SyriaTel in the near future. By identifying at-risk customers, the model will enable SyriaTel to take proactive measures to prevent churn, improve customer retention, and optimize retention strategies, ultimately reducing customer loss.

## Business Problem
---------------------------------------------------
SyriaTel, like most telecommunications companies, faces a challenge in maintaining customer loyalty. Customers can choose from various providers, and churn (i.e., the rate at which customers leave) represents a significant source of revenue loss. High churn rates also lead to increased customer acquisition costs and decreased market share. Understanding which customers are likely to leave can help SyriaTel take targeted actions to improve retention, reduce churn, and ultimately boost profitability.

## Business Understanding
----------------------------------------------------
By accurately predicting customer churn, SyriaTel can:

1.Identify at-risk customers: Target high-risk customers who are likely to churn with tailored retention strategies such as personalized offers, improved customer service, or loyalty rewards.
2.Optimize marketing spend: Focus marketing efforts on retaining existing customers, reducing the need for costly customer acquisition.
3.Improve customer experience: By understanding the drivers of churn, SyriaTel can enhance its offerings, address pain points, and boost overall satisfaction, leading to higher customer loyalty.
4.Reduce operational costs: Reducing churn can lower the costs associated with acquiring new customers to replace lost ones, thus improving profitability.
